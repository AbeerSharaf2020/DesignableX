# DesignableX
This repository holds @IBDesignable files that can be used to extend the Interface Builder and make it easier to customize controls on the Storyboard.

DISCLAIMER
These are for my own personal use but anyone is welcome to use them at their own risk. I do not guarantee they are or will be 100% error free.

## How to use
Take this folder: DesignableXTesting > DesignableXTesting > DesignableX
And add it to your project.
On your storyboard, select a control and in the Identity Inspector, click the drop down for a custom class and select one of the UI____X files.
In the Attributes Inspector, change the new properties.
